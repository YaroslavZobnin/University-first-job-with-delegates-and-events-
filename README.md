The program is a control point that allows you to change the name of a faculty and award top students at one of the universities.
The program displays a menu to the user, where they can select one of several options.
The first option displays all the information about the faculty and its students (who are already registered with the faculty). 
The second option allows you to change the name of the faculty (which must be selected first), and the name of the faculty will be changed immediately for all the students.
The third option is a reward for students who are top students.
The fourth option displays help information, including a description of the menu, the program's features, and information for developers. 

After some time, the program was finalized. At this point in time, the program is considered complete (19.02.2026). 
The program is a laboratory project at my university.
